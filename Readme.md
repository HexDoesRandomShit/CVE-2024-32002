Improved version of the CVE in gitea for RCE.
Instructions:
Create 2 repo's 
    
    1. Repo1
    
    2. Repo2
    
    3. put your payload (use a powershell base64 rev shell) and modify the links in the right place in the **exploit.sh**...
    
    4. When someone clones recursivly the repo's, you get a call back.

**IMPORTANT** 
You may want to try to clone both repos a few times : ex, with subdomain, without, with ip, etc..
You'll get a shell eventually xd.
